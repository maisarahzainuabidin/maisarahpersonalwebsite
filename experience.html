			<p>Brodin Station is a restaurant that provide many kind of western food at a reasonable price and many people enjoy their food.  It is located at Ketereh, Kelantan on the left side of Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Ketereh.  This is my first work experience.  I work at Brodin Station after SPM and from there I realise how hard it is to make money and how we should appreciate our parents more.  I work as a waiter where i need to get order from customers, serve the food and clean tables.  From there I learn how to act with many customers with many kind of attitudes and it is a valuable experience working there</p>

			<p>Pizza Hut G-Orange is located at Tunjong about 15 minutes from my home, Ketereh.  I work here during my semester break.  My work is to greet customers, take orders, serve the food, clean the table and setting up the table.  I really enjoy working there because it is more professional than my previous work where there is rules that need to be follow since Pizza Hut is a well-known brand.  I learn so many things there and met so many people who are really kind and sweet.  I am really thankful for the precious experience i got and for the managers who have taught me so much things</p>
